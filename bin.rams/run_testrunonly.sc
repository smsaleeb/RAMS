# This script will run a single test serially (by default) (on any system) or in
# parallel (on a simple computer cluster that does not use a PBS/QSUB queuing
# system). Note that many supercomputing systems (that use modules and PBS
# queuing systems) often have different methods for compiling code for serial
# or parallel processing. The correct compiling method is required for running
# this script in parallel or serial.
#
# A couple of important items here for this test simulation.
# 1. RAMSIN.testrunonly - produces a 3D 1-grid supercell simulation with
#  LEVEL=3 microphysics
# 2. This idealized simulation does not require geographical data (sfctypehdf5)
#  for running since geography does not matter. Also, we do not need gridded
#  initialization data beyond the sounding input in the namelist. The sounding
#  is applied horizontally homogeneous for an idealized run.
#
# Here is a sample executable statement for running RAMS in parallel,
#  but NOT on a supercomputer using a PBS QSUB queuing system. Consult their
#  userguides for running parallel jobs on their systems. Each system is unique.
# /home/smsaleeb/software/mpich-3.3.2/bin/mpiexec -machinefile machs -np 8 \
# ./bin.rams/rams-6.3.01 -f RAMSIN.testrunonly
# Note: might have to add (-iface eth0) to this executable statement or
#  something similar depending on how your compute nodes communicate. Use
#  utility (ifconfig) to find out how your nodes communicate (ie. eth0 or eth1).
#
# Do not blindly use this script for running every simulation. It is simply
# included here as a starting point and because I use this frequently on my
# desktop Linux workstation for RAMS tests and debugging. If using this script
# and RAMSIN namelist, please become familiar with its flags, settings, and
# functionality. They cannot be used for every runtime situation. Many RAMSIN
# flags in this test example are turned on for testing only and are not
# appropriate for a real simulation to study.
